# Component Conventions

All components inside components/ must: 
- Use PascalCase for filenames (e.g., Navbar.tsx). 
- Define props interfaces with the name <ComponentName>Props. 
- Use TypeScript function components with explicit return types. 
- Export components as named functions, not defaults.
