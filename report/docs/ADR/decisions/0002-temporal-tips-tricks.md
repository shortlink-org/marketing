# 2. Effective Use of Temporal: Tips, Tools, and Best Practices

Date: 2023-11-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Temporal is a robust platform for orchestrating microservices using workflows. As we integrate Temporal into our architecture, 
it's imperative to be aware of various features, tools, and best practices to make the most out of it.

## Decision

1. **Documentation & Courses**

  - For a solid foundation on Temporal, refer to the official [documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/).
  - Temporal offers an extensive course for deeper insights into its features and best practices. 
      Enrolling in this [course](https://learn.temporal.io/courses) will provide the team with comprehensive knowledge 
      and hands-on experience.

2. **Observability with Prometheus & Grafana**

  - Temporalâ€™s observability features seamlessly integrate with tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. 
      These can significantly aid in workflow monitoring, performance analysis, and system health checks.
  - With Prometheus and Grafana, we can create custom dashboards and set up alerts, ensuring real-time 
      monitoring and proactive issue management.

3. **Linting for Determinism - WorkflowCheck Tool**
  
  - Determinism in Temporal workflows is paramount. The [`workflowcheck`]()https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/tree/master/contrib/tools/workflowcheck tool can assist in maintaining this.

4. **Versioning Workflows**
  
  - Workflows evolve, and so does the business logic. Implementing a versioning strategy for Temporal workflows ensures 
      we manage changes without disrupting running workflows. 

5. **Using Timeouts**
  
  - Timeouts in Temporal workflows are essential to handle scenarios where tasks or activities might take longer than expected, 
      preventing indefinite waits and potential system hangups. (The specific link provided earlier was inaccessible during verification.)


## Consequences

- Adopting these practices will bolster workflow operations, mitigate potential pitfalls, and augment the user experience.
- Implementing proper observability will elevate the system's performance and reliability standards.
- Regular checks with the `workflowcheck` tool will preserve determinism in our workflows.
- Through versioning and effective timeout settings, we ensure operational continuity, resource optimization, and facilitate smooth updates.
